# Welcome!

My name is Isabela Zeberio (she/her), a Social Scientist with a passion for exploring identities, cultural evolution, and human interactions through computational methodology. 

ðŸ”¬ Research Focus:
Currently, I am a second-year PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam, actively involved in the EUDENTIFY research project that aims to study the long-term trends and causal mechanisms in the link between European Union institution building and European identity formation ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º.

ðŸ“š Background:
I hold a background in Political Science and International Studies and a Master's degree in Computational Social Science from the University Carlos III of Madrid. My interdisciplinary perspective enables me to bridge the gap between Social Science theories and computational methodologies.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:i.zeberioaguerrevere@uva.nl) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
